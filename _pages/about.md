## Bio

As someone who enjoys new ventures and taking chances, I have built a wide range of expertise over the years. Through each endeavor I have taken on, I have gained something valuable. From serving my country to software development, my interests are varied but have brought meaning and purpose to my life. Now, I am sharing the wealth of knowledge from my pursuits in hopes of inspiring and educating others.

I grew up in a small town just north of Salt Lake City, Utah, called Roy. At 18-years-old I joined the U.S. Army and spent the next 20 years serving my country as a 31B-Military Police Officer. I was deployed twice on active duty during that time, including a year in Afghanistan and another year in Iraq. During my time in the Army, I earned my bachelor’s degree in Criminal Justice. 

I have been a strong proponent of off-grid living outside of my work. I have written a book now available for purchase called “Off the Grid: A Starter Guide to Becoming Self-Sufficient Through Simple Living,” which shows readers how they can live outside of modern society by utilizing their resources and work ethic. With my guidance, I help others see the potential they already possess for being able to survive in the most unexpected circumstances.
In addition to being a published author, I have also been working toward a second bachelor’s degree in Computer Information systems. While in school, I am also attending a backend code developer boot camp to obtain a certification in SQL and DevOps Developer with Python. By the end of my training, I hope to become a backend developer. 

In my personal life, I have been fortunate enough to be married for nearly 16 years and am the father of 3 beautiful children. While I am proud of my accomplishments, I am always looking for new ways to challenge myself and grow through new discoveries.
